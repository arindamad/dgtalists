                                    <p>When it comes to useful business applications of machine learning, it doesn’t get much better than
                                        customer churn prediction. Churn rate is a critical metric of customer satisfaction. Low churn rates
                                        mean happy customers; high churn rates mean customers are leaving you. It takes a lot more money
                                        (up to five times more) to get new customers than to keep the ones you already have.</p>

                                    <p>A telecom company wanted a report on its customer churn rate. An understanding of the problem is
                                        critical in devising a solution. The churn rate in this case provides clarity on the quality of the
                                        business, shows customer satisfaction with the service, and allows for comparison with competitors
                                        to gauge an acceptable level of churn.</p>

                                                    <p>We then created a baseline model with a Logistic Regression algorithm, then predict with other machine learning models like Support Vector classifier (SVC), Random Forest classifier, Decision-tree classifier, and Naive-Bayes classifier.</p>
